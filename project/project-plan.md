# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate change will sink the world !!

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. will the Climate change effect the sea level which may sink some of the cities?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
We want to look into the complex relationship between sea level fluctuations and climate change in our data science research. The Earth's climate is altered by human activity, such as the production of fossil fuels, which causes the polar ice caps and glaciers to melt and raises global temperatures. Sea levels are increasing as a result, and this poses serious risks to infrastructure, coastal communities, and ecosystems across the globe.

We want to comprehend the causes and effects of this event using thorough data analysis and modeling methodologies. Our goal is to find patterns, trends, and plausible future scenarios of sea level rise by examining historical climate and sea level data along with forecasts from climate models. Additionally, Our goal is to evaluate the socioeconomic effects of sea level rise, taking into account the dangers to coastal ecosystems, economies, and people.

Our initiative also intends to provide useful insights to reduce the effects of sea level rise and improve resilience in susceptible areas, which will aid in well-informed decision-making and policy formulation. We want to support efforts towards sustainable adaptation and mitigation methods by comprehending the intricate interactions between sea level rise and climate change. In the end, we want to work towards a more egalitarian and robust future for everybody.
